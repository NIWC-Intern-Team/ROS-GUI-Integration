## TO Create Docker Container
first go to filespace dockerfile is held in
next build using "docker build -t my_phidget_image ."

## TO Run Docker Containter
run "docker run -it --device=/dev/bus/usb --net=host --restart=unless-stopped my_phidget_image"
next, open a new terminal outside the container
next do "sudo reboot"
next check the docker is still running
if running, exec into it and check that ros2 topics include 6 phidget publishers
next cut power and check again that docker and ros are working
once the docker is working consitantly, you are done


## ABOUT
# --device=/dev/bus/usb
gives docker access to all usb ports (necessary for accessing phidgets no matter their port)
see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24225647/docker-a-way-to-give-access-to-a-host-usb-or-serial-device
# --net=host
the docker container is inside the host network (lets the baystation view rostopics published by container)
# --restart=unless-stopped
once run, the system will run until manually turned off (will restart even if the system is powered off)
note: must restart after starting the container to ensure it launches after poweroff
see: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/

## Some Basic Docker Commands
"docker ps" #views current containers running
"docker exec -it <container_id> bash" #opens a terminal within the docker container

##ON EACH MACHINE
do:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.202:11311

docker run -e ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.202:11311 -e ROS_IP=<container_ip> -it
